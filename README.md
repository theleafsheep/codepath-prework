## Required Functionality

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [ ] Game interface has a heading (h1 tag), a line of body text (p tag), and four buttons that match the demo app
* [ ] "Start" button toggles between "Start" and "Stop" when clicked. 
* [ ] Game buttons each light up and play a sound when clicked. 
* [ ] Computer plays back sequence of clues including sound and visual cue for each button
* [ ] Play progresses to the next turn (the user gets the next step in the pattern) after a correct guess. 
* [ ] User wins the game after guessing a complete pattern
* [ ] User loses the game after an incorrect guess

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [ ] Any HTML page elements (including game buttons) has been styled differently than in the tutorial
* [ ] Buttons use a pitch (frequency) other than the ones in the tutorial
* [ ] More than 4 functional game buttons
* [ ] Playback speeds up on each turn
* [ ] Computer picks a different pattern each time the game is played
* [ ] Player only loses after 3 mistakes (instead of on the first mistake)
* [ ] Game button appearance change goes beyond color (e.g. add an image)
* [ ] Game button sound is more complex than a single tone (e.g. an audio file, a chord, a sequence of multiple tones)
* [ ] User has a limited amount of time to enter their guess on each turn

The following **additional** features are implemented:

## Reflection Questions
1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here.

Since I already have some experience with HTML, CSS, and JS, I was able to just follow the tutorials provided on CodePath. The only video I used was a YouTube video about generating links from GIF's to embed into this READ ME.

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 

I did not face any significant challenges during this submission! All the steps on CodePath were very clear. The only problem I had was generating the GIF links, which I solved by using a YouTube video. I realized I could just drag in the link from the File Explorer.

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) 

I know there are a lot of different front-end and back-end web development languages, like React, Express, Node, Angular, and etc. As well as database structures like PostgreSQL and MongoDB. I was wondering where it would be most beneficial to learn as a beginning web developer? Is it better to continue learning a lot of them or getting professional experience in just a few?

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) 

I would try to reorganize the buttons so that they are centered firstly. Then I would make the buttons unclickable when the pattern is currently playing. After I would generate random sequences each time rather than the static pattern. Then I would create another game mode option where the buttons would randomly change locations with each button press, so players have to remember the color associated with the sound, rather than just the location!
